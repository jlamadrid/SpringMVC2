SpringMVC2
==========
This project was created to help enforce Spring concepts in addition to 
experimenting with features released in Spring 4 (e.g. @RestController).

This version of Spring MVC will also use 100% programmatic configuration in contrast to SpringMVC
which used xml to configure much of the plumbing.



TODO
=====
- Use Spring Data REST to expose JPA entities via RESTFul controllers: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaiH1HsacPs
